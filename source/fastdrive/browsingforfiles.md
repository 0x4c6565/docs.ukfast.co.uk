# Is there a way I can browse for a specific file or folder?

You may encounter an issue where you can't find one of your files or folders. This may be because you haven't accessed it for a while and
can't remember exactly where it is located.

If this is the case, you can directly search for a file or folder using the search function.

## Searching for files in the FASTdrive web app

At the top of every page you will search a small magnifying glass. Clicking this icon will expand the search box.
