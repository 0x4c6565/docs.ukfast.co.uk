# Address books

There are 2 different address books available in FASTdrive; the __shared address book__ and the __personal address book__

The shared address book contains contacts which are visible to all employee users. When you are creating an employee account, you will have the option to add that user to the __shared address book__.

The shared address book is useful because it allows your employee users to be able to easily send files and messages to each other. If a
user is only added to your __personal address book__ it will mean that only you will be able to see that contact.

For the most part, you will be using your address book when you are sharing files with other users. For a detailed walkthrough on how to
share files, [click here](https://docs.ukfast.co.uk/fastdrive/sharingfiles.html)
