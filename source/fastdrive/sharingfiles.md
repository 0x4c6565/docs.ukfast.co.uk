# Sharing files

In FASTdrive, you can share files and folders so that other people can access them. You can share files and folders with both FASTdrive users and non-FASTdrive users via the sharing feature that is available within FASTdrive.

In order to share a file with someone else, firstly navigate to that file within the FASTdrive web app. In this instance I have delved into my personal folder so that I can share a folder named __TestFolder1__.

To the left of the folder name, there is a checkbox so that you can select this folder. Tick this box and you will see the variety of options that are available to you. In this instance, we want to share this file, so click the __share__ button.

Two options will then appear; __Email with ShareFile__ and __Get a Link__. These are two different ways of sharing files.

You can share files via the ShareFile email system. Messages can be sent to FASTdrive users and non FASTdrive users and can be encrypted too if you like.
