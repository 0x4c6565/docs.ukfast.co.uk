# How can I schedule downtime when performing maintenance?

If you are performing some maintenance on your solution then you are able to schedule downtime within MyUKFast so that alerts aren't raised during this time.

To begin, you must first login to your MyUKFast area and access the Dedicated Servers link via the 'Products and Services' menu, which is located across the top of the page.

Within this section you will be presented with a list of devices available to you. You can search and browse through these, clicking on the IP or Name to take you to the specific device.

On the Details tab you arrive on you should see the Monitoring section which will list all of the schedule downtime windows for this server.
