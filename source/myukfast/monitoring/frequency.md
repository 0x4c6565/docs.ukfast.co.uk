# How often are the monitoring checks?

We provide two levels of monitoring, so this will depend on which service you are subscribed to.

## Standard Monitoring

All service checks are run at a pre-defined interval of 5 minutes (300 seconds). Alerts themselves will be generated every 15 minutes.

## Enterprise Monitoring

All service checks are run at a pre-defined interval of 1 minute (60 seconds). Alerts themselves will be generated every 3 minutes.
