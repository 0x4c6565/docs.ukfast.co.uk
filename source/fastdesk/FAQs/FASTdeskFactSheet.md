The FASTdesk Pro Plus plan is an upgrade to the Pro plan. With the FASTdesk Pro Plus plan, you will again have your own dedicated XenDesktop Virtual Machine but the specification of this will be 4 vCPU with 8GB RAM.

## What is included in 1st line support and what hours do we support?

1st line support is available to you between Monday and Friday, 9am - 6pm (Excluding UK Bank Holidays). Our support will be available whilst working within the FASTdesk environment. This means that our support covers the Windows operating system that you'll be working within, FASTdrive, Office 2016, and other general end user issues that you may encounter.

## Are my files backed up on FASTdesk?

Your home folder is backed up at file level and is available for 28 days. Virtual Machines are snapshotted at the storage level and are available for 28 days.

## How is security and encryption integrated into FASTdesk?

All FASTdesk data is encrypted via a 2048 bit RSA SSL. All connections into the environment are secured via Netscaler Gateways. FASTdesk is encrypted end-to-end, meaning all data within the environment is sent over HTTPS.

## Can I supply my own Microsoft licenses?

Yes, you can provide your own Microsoft licenses for applications such as Office and SQL, providing that this has been pre-arranged before your solution is launched.

## What is an Application Server?

Application servers are required when one of your applications requires a back end of any type; whether that be a database or so that data can be isolated etc. For example, one of your applications may connect to an SQL database so if you wished to install this application, you would need an application server.

## Is Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) supported?

Unfortunately due to FASTdesk being a multi-tenated environment, we don't support the integration of your Active Directory within FASTdesk.
