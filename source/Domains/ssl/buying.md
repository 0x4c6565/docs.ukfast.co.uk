```eval_rst
.. note::
  This guide is just on how to purchase an SSL from UKFast.
  For information on the different types of SSL certificates available please see the following page:
  :doc:`/myukfast/ssl/types`
```

SSL certificates are available to purchase via the MyUKFast Panel [here](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/ssl/buy.php)

Once you've selected the SSL which best matches youre requirements, click `Buy Now`. You'll be taken to a page that requires some information be entered pertaining to the body responsible for the domain in question.

Once you've filled in the required information you'll then need to go through the validation process to ensure you're entitled to purchase an SSL for the domain in question. There are a few options available for validation, these are:

  * File Upload - You will be required to upload a .txt file to the root of your website that must be publicly accessible. Once validation is complete, this file can be safely removed.
  * DNS Lookup -  You will be required to create a new CNAME record for your domain. Once validation is complete, this record can be safely deleted
  * Email - You will be required to click a link sent to a specific email address(the list of addresses this link can be sent to will be listed if this option is selected).

Once validation is complete, if you've selected the option for UKFast to install this SSL for you a member of the UKFast Support team will be in contact with you to confirm when this SSL is installed.

If you've chosen to install this SSL yourself, a link to the SSL will be made available to you via the MyUKFast Panel once validation is completed.
