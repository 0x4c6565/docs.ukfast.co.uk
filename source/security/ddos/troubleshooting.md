## I can't connect my domain(s) to the DDoS Protection network

If you're struggling to connect your domains, first check that you are using [SafeDNS](/source/Domains/safedns/index) to manage your DNS records.  You neeed to use SafeDNS and point your domains to the UKFast nameservers, which are
- ns0.ukfast.co.uk
- ns1.ukfast.co.uk

You'll find SafeDNS in [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk) - just log in and go to `SafeDNS` under the `Products and Services` menu.  You should also read the full [SafeDNS guide](/source/Domains/safedns/index)
