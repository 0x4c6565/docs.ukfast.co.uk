eCloud Flex provides access to the full range of OpenStack APIs, which is the most powerful way to take advantage of the capability available.  

There is a wealth of documentation and guidance available on the various OpenStack websites, including

* [OpenStack.org](https://openstack.org)
* [OpenStack documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/)
* [Developer resources](https://developer.openstack.org/)
