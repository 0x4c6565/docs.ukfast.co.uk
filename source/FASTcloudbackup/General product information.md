# General product information

## What is FASTcloudbackup?

FASTcloudbackup is a file and folder backup solution, based on Commvault technology.  It's designed to backup computers and servers running Linux, Windows and Mac.  For full details and pricing, visit [the UKFast website](https://www.ukfast.co.uk/fastcloudbackup.html)

## How does FASTcloudbackup work?

FASTcloudbackup works by installing an agent onto the computers and servers you wish to backup.  Once installed, you can configure and manage backups and restores through the [FASTcloudbackup web console](https://fcb.ukfast.co.uk) 

## Where is my data stored once it's been backed up?

Data is backed up to the FASTcloudbackup platform hosted in our [Manchester-based data centres](https://www.ukfast.co.uk/our-datacentres.html).  We guarantee your data will never leave the UK.

## How is my data kept secure?

All data sent during the backup process is encrypted using the HTTPS protocol, meaning it’s secure from the moment it leaves your computers and servers. You will need port 8600 open on your firewall, so that the FASTcloudbackup agent can communicate with the backup servers hosted in our data centre.

Once your data reaches our FASTcloudbackup servers it’s secured using AES-256 bit encryption – the standard used by companies and governments around the world to protect sensitive data. Our UK data centres are ISO27001 certified and PCI-DSS compliant.

## What is the data retention period?

28 days for all files backed up.
