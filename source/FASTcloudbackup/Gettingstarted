# Getting started

First you'll need to login to MyUKFast and navigate to FASTcloudbackup, which is in the Products & Services drop down menu.

On this page you can choose how much storage quota you need.  Note that you can have multiple FASTcloudbackup end user accounts within your overall MyUKFast account, and that you purchase storage quota on a "per end user account" basis.  To get started, choose the amount of storage quoata you want for your first end user account.  You can create more end user accounts, each with their own storage quota, later on.
