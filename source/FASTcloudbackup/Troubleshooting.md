You should not use this process to add new computers or servers to be backed up - instead please follow the instructions shown on [Setting up the FASTcloudbackup agent](link) - this will guide you through installing the agent so you can run and manage backups.

## Problems browsing file structure

FASTcloudbackup runs as a system service and so cannot pre-select or utilise shortcuts to folders such as Documents or Photos.  In order to find the folders you wish to backup you'll need to navigate through the full path - for example `C:\Users\[username]\Documents\[foldername]`

To make navigation simpler for folders you need to access regularly you can set up Favourite folders - see [Favourite folders](link) for instructions.
