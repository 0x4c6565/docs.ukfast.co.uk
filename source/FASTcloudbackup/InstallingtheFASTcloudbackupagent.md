Please note that the installation process will add a Migration Assistant to your laptop, but you don't need to use this once you've completed the agent installation.  Simply head back to the [FASTcloudbackup web console](https://fcb.ukfast.co.uk) and continue as set out below.

## Installing the agent - Linux

[Oli please can you write this section, I have no experience of setting up the Linux version]

## Checking the agent is set up correctly

Once you've installed the agent on your computer or server, you can check it's been set up properly by heading back to the [FASTcloudbackup web console](https://fcb.ukfast.co.uk).  From the home page click `My Data` and you'll be taken to a page called Computers.  On here you will see the computer(s) and server(s) you have installed the FASTcloudbackup agent on to.
