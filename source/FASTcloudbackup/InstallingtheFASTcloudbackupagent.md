## Installing the agent - Linux

[Oli please can you write this section, I have no experience of setting up the Linux version]

## Checking the agent is set up correctly

Once you've installed the agent on your computer or server, you can check it's been set up properly by heading back to the FASTcloudbackup web console.  From the home page click `My Data` and you'll be taken to a page called Computers.  On here you will see the computer(s) and server(s) you have installed the FASTcloudbackup agent on to.
